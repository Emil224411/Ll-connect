## Im going to rewrite this, there are certain parts of it that needs to be refactored.
I still use it, but that doesn't mean everybody should.

Ll-connect(Linux l-connect) has almost all the features of L-connect 3
it's not perfect but it works, if you have any issues or suggestions let me know.

it currently only supports the UNI HUB AL v2

dependencies: SDL2, SDL2_ttf(for the ui)
