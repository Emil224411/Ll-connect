Ll-connect(Linux l-connect) has almost all the features of L-connect 3
it's not perfect but it works, if you have any issues or suggestions let me know.

it currently only supports the UNI HUB AL v2

dependencies: SDL2, SDL2_ttf(for the ui)

install:
	1.  clone the github repository

	2.  Open a terminal and cd "path/to/repo"

	3.  run "sudo make install" to compile and install the ui

	4.  cd in to the kernel directory in the repository

	6.  run "sudo make install" to install the driver

	7.  run "sudo modprobe Lian_Li_UNI_HUB_ALv2"

	8.  start "Ll-connect" from the terminal or how ever you start programs

you can skip step 6. and 7. if you dont want the driver to start on boot since it could cause some issues 
i have it installed and it hasnt caused any issues but i cant promise it will work perfectly for you
if you want to skip step 6. and 7. you will have to open a terminal, 
cd in to "path/to/Ll-connect/kernel" and run "sudo make module" and then you will have to run "sudo insmod Lian_Li_UNI_HUB_ALv2.ko" every time you start your pc

if you want to use it without the ui skip step 3 you can use the proc files at "/proc/Lian_li_hub/" but i would not recommend it

uninstall ui:
	1. cd "path/to/Ll_connect"

	2. "make uninstall"

	3. "make clean"(optional)

uninstall driver:
	1. cd "path/to/Ll_connect/kernel"

	2. "sudo make clean"
