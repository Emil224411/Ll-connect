Ll-connect(Linux l-connect) has almost all the features of L-connect 3
it's not done yet but i'm working on it

it currently only supports the UNI HUB AL v2 but i would be happy to add support for other hubs i just need some usb packets

dependencies: SDL2, SDL2_ttf(for the ui)

install:
	1.  clone the github repository

	2.  Open a terminal and cd "path/to/repo"

	3.  run "sudo make install" to compile and install the ui

	4.  cd in to the kernel directory in the repository

	5.  run "make" to compile the driver

	6.  run "sudo make install" to install the driver

	7.  run "sudo modprobe Lian_Li_UNI_HUB_ALv2"

	8.  start "Ll-connect" from the terminal or how ever you start programs

it is still being worked on so you can skip step 6. and 7. if you dont want the driver to start on booy since it could cause some issues 
i have it installed and it hasnt caused any issues but i cant promise it will work perfectly for you
if you want to skip step 6. and 7. you will have to open a terminal, 
cd in to "path/to/Ll-connect/kernel" and run "sudo insmod Lian_Li_UNI_HUB_ALv2.ko" every time you start your pc

if you want to use it without the ui skip step 3 you can use the proc files at "/proc/Lian_li_hub/" but i would not recommend it
