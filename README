it's not done yet but i'm working on it and 
it can do more or less the same as L-connect but its just on linux

it currently only supports the AL V2 UNI HUB but i would be happy to add support for other hubs i just need some usb packets

dependencies: SDL2, SDL2_ttf(for the ui)

install:
   1.  clone the repo

   2.  cd to the repo

   3.  run "sudo make install"

   4.  cd to the kernel directory

   5.  run "make"

   6.  run "make install" and then run "sudo modprobe Lian_li_hub"
if you skipped step 6. run "sudo insmod Lian_li_hub.ko" instead of "sudo modprobe Lian_li_hub"

   8.  run "Ll-connect" from the terminal or how ever you run programs

if you want to use it without the ui skip step 3 you can use the proc files at "/proc/Lian_li_hub/" but i would not recommend it
