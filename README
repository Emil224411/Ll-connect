it's not done yet but i'm working on it and it works pretty well

you can set fan curves for each port and your fan speeds will update every 2 seconds
when you reboot your pc you will have to run Ll-connect again and apply the fan curve to each port but it will save the fan curves so it takes 5 clicks

you can also set the rgb

install:
   1.  clone the repo

   2.  cd to the repo

   3.  run "sudo make install"

   4.  cd to the kernel directory

   5.  run "make"

   6.  (not recommended currently since the driver is not done and it might cause some issues) run "make install"

   7.  run "sudo insmod Lian_li_hub.ko"(currently you should do this every time you boot your pc)

   8.  run "Ll-connect" from the terminal or how ever you run programs
